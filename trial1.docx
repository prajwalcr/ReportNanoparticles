*ABSTRACT
One of the most important metal oxide nanoparticles, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles,
were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The synthesis ZnO nanorods were 
carried out using an organic solvent (methanol) and in the presence of 
hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as an organic additive. The size of the 
synthesized ZnO nanorods (around 100 nm in length and 10-15nm diameter). The main 
point of this study is to investigate the influence of the ZnO nanocatalysts on the 
photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. As-synthesized ZnO nanorods 
were characterized utilizing Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller, (BET) and UV-Visible spectroscopic techniques. 
The XRD data analyses provide that ZnO nanorods have hexagonal crystalline 
structure.

*INTRODUCTION:

*Research On Synthesis And Characterization Of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles:


Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles:

Hydrothermal synthesis method was used for the synthesis of Zinc Oxide nanoparticles. Hydrothermal synthesis method involves using any one of the many techniques to crystallize substances. It usually does at a high vapor pressure level and using a high-temperature aqueous solution; hence it is termed as ‘Hydro’ + ‘Thermal’ = Hydrothermal method.

In easy terms, hydrothermal synthesis described as an artificial way to synthesize single-crystal (nanoparticles). Also, It depends on the solubility of aqueous solution under hot water and higher temperature levels. A strong container within the hydrothermal reactor ‘Autoclave’, and fill with a solution. The process wants constant maintenance of temperature difference between the opposing ends of the crystallizing compartment.
The end with higher temperature is wherever the solvent dissolved. While in the other end, which is comparatively cooler, where the nanoparticle growth takes place.
Chemicals and reagents:

Zinc nitrate Zn (NO3 )2 .6H2 O, potassium hydroxide (KOH), methanol (CH3 OH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), methylene blue (C14H14N3 O3 SNa)  and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with the highest purity were used.

Instruments:

A JEOL instrument (TEM, JEOL Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was utilized for collecting TEM images of the ZnO nanorods with adjustment of an acceleration voltage of 200kV. The powder XRD patterns were executed using a Philips” diffractometer (type PW 1730) with Nifiltered, Co radiation (l = 1.79) at 30kV and 20mA. The specific area of the as-synthesized nanorods was determined utilizing, Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller, nitrogen adsorption method. This measurement was carried out using a Micrometrics instrument model ASAP 2010. The UV-visible recording spectrophotometer Shimadzu-Japan was used to detect the absorbance of light wavelengths.

Hydrothermal synthesis method:

Synthesis of the ZnO nanorods was executed according to the following procedure, 20mL of 1M KOH was mixed with 100mL of CH3 OH and the mixture was stirred for 10min using magnetic stirrer, and then, 20 mL of 0.4 M Zn(NO3 )2 .6H2 O solution was mixed with the above solution. The mixture was stirred for 10min, and then, 20mL of the mixed solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (25mL capacity). The autoclave was firmly blocked. The autoclave transferred to furnace and the temperature was adjusted at 120 0 C for 5hrs. CTAB as an organic precursor was added to the resulting solution in order to monitor the morphology of the ZnO particles. After the reaction was finished, the autoclave was cooled down in the air, and the white ZnO nanorods powder was centrifuged and washed several times with water and ethanol respectively.


Characterisation of ZnO nanoparticles:






CONCLUSION:
Research was carried out on the “Synthesis and Characterization of ZnO 
nanoparticles”. ZnO nanorods were synthesized by hydrothermal methods.The 
photocatalyst synthesized by hydrothermal method had hexagonal crystalline structure. 
The ZnO nanorods  were characterized in terms of morphology and size by utilizing 
XRD, TEM, and BET. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanorods was investigated 
utilizing degradation of MB dye.
